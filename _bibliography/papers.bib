  abstract = {In this demo, we present PaintBall, a tool that facilitates creative art creation and manipulation from movement data. It is designed as a public computation project aimed to foster conversation and connection between youth with different interests (specifically art, sports, or computing) at a community center around the shared activity of creating these rich visualizations and art pieces. We expect the design features of PaintBall – public art and tinkering work, cross interest engagement, and discrete artifact generation – to be key ideas that can be used across a variety of contexts and enable rich community development among youth by providing novel touchstones for conversation as well as reflection on these preexisting activities themselves.

  abstract="AI technology is rapidly evolving and has vast potential for educational applications. This paper focuses on the technical iterations that took place as our project team developed a semi-intelligent conversational agent (CA) that uses speech recognition to fire spoken prompts to promote caregiver-child interaction as they read books aloud together. Situating this work in a design-based research methodology, the technical iterations reported here are part of the iterative ``build'' phase. (Easterday et al., 2018; Hoadley {\&} Campos, 2022). The CA app promotes conversations between caregivers and children by listening to the human dyads as they read, matching their spoken words to marker words that would pinpoint the page of the storybook the dyads are reading, and playing a prompt corresponding to the page. The dynamic system that supports the app involves multiple components: web accessible services, data processing services, and human outputs, and it has gone through a combined seven iterations in three prototypes. Though a very small part of the DBR cycle, the technical iterations presented here have the potential to inform others interested in incorporating text-to-speech and other AI technologies into educational applications. We close with considerations for future directions.",

  abstractNote={Culturally relevant and sustaining implementations of computing education are increasingly leveraging young learners’ passion for sports as a platform for building interest in different STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) concepts. Numerous disciplines spanning physics, engineering, data science, and especially AI based computing are not only authentically used in professional sports in today’s world, but can also be productively introduced to introduce young learnres to these disciplines and facilitate deep engagement with the same in the context of sports. In this work, we present a curriculum that includes a constellation of proprietary apps and tools we show student athletes learning sports like basketball and soccer that use AI methods like pose detection and IMU-based gesture detection to track activity and provide feedback. We also share Scratch extensions which enable rich access to sports related pose, object, and gesture detection algorithms that youth can then tinker around with and develop their own sports drill applications. We present early findings from pilot implementations of portions of these tools and curricula, which also fostered discussion relating to the failings, risks, and social harms associated with many of these different AI methods – noticeable in professional sports contexts, and relevant to youths’ lives as active users of AI technologies as well as potential future creators of the same.},

Previous work in AI ethics literacy have developed curriculum and classroom activities that engage learners in reflecting on the ethical implications of AI systems and developing responsible AI. There is little work in using game-based learning methods in AI literacy. Games are known to be compelling media to teach children about complex STEM concepts. In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called “AI Audit” where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms. In this paper, we present the game design, teacher resources for classroom deployment and early playtesting results. We discuss our reflections about using games as teaching tools for AI literacy in K-12 classrooms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new metric – Joint Choice Time (JCT) – to measure how and when visitors are collaborating around an interactive museum exhibit. This extends dwell time, one of the most commonly used metrics for museum engagement – which tends to be individual, and sacrifices insight into activity and learning details for measurement simplicity. We provide an exemplar of measuring JCT using a common “diversity metric” for collaborative choices and potential outcomes. We provide an implementable description of the metric, results from using the metric with our own data, and potential implications for designing museum exhibits and easily measuring social engagement. Here, we apply JCT to an interactive exhibit game called “Rainbow Agents” where museum visitors can play independently or work together to tend to a virtual garden using computer science concepts. Our data showed that diversity of meaningful choices positively correlated with both dwell time and diversity of positive and creative outcomes. JCT - as a productive as well as easy to access measure of social work - provides an example for learning analytics practitioners and researchers (especially in museums) to consider centering social engagement and work as a rich space for easily assessing effective learning experiences for museum visitors.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an implementation of Connected Spaces (CxS)—an ambient help seeking interface designed and developed for a project-based computing classroom. We use actor network theory (ANT) to provide an underutilized posthumanist lens to understand the creation of collaborative connections in this Computational Action-based implementation. Posthumanism offers an emerging and critical extension to sociocultural perspectives on understanding learning, by pushing us to decenter the human, and consider the active roles that human and non-human entities play in learning environments by actively shaping each other. We analyse how students in this class adjusted their help-seeking and collaborative habits following the introduction of CxS, a tool designed to foster (more inter-group) collaboration. ANT proposes generalized symmetry—a principle of considering human, non-human and more than human entities with equivalent and comparable agency, leading to describing phenomena as networks of actors in different evolving relationships with each other. Analysing collaborative interactions as fostered by CxS using an ANT approach supports design-based research—an iterative design revision process highlighting understandings about design as well as learning—by providing a temporal and informative lens into the relationship between actors and tools within the environment. Our key findings include a framing of technologies in classrooms as bridging agentic gaps between students and becoming actors engaging in different behaviours; learners enacting new agencies through technologies (for instance a more comfortable non-intrusive help seeker), and the need for voicing and teachers to connect help networks in CxS equipped classrooms. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Collaborative learning is a valuable skill and practice; opportunities to mentor others are critical in empowering minoritized learners, especially in STEM and computing disciplines. School norms solidify a power and expertise hierarchy between teachers and learners and fail to productively support learners in learning from each other. Additionally, lack of awareness about peers' knowledge is a common hindrance in students knowing who to ask for help and how. What this paper adds An example of a designed interface called Connected Spaces with potential to foster more inter-student collaboration, especially outside of mandated within-group collaboration—in the form of cross-group help seeking and help giving. A design based research study using actor network theory highlighting the limitations of Connected Spaces in sparking notable behaviour change among students by itself but being retooled as a teacher support tool in enabling cross-group collaborations. Presenting conceptions of collaboration through technologies as bridging agentic gaps and acting with new agencies in performing help-seeking related actions. Provoking the idea of testing emerging technologies in classrooms along with sharing our analyses and reflections with the classroom as a key idea in computing education—surfacing the gap between designed intentions and the different kinds of extra social work needed in the on-ground success of different technologies. Implications for practice and/or policy Designers and researchers should create and test more interfaces alongside teachers across different classrooms and contexts aimed at supporting different kinds of voluntary collaborative interactions. Curricula, standards and school practices should further center providing students with opportunities to engage as mentors and build communities of learning across disciplines to empower minoritized students. Researchers engaging in design based research should consider using more posthumanist lenses to examine educational technologies and how they affect change in learning environments.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
