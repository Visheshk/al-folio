[Curriculum Vitae (last updated November, 2023)](http://bit.ly/vishesh-cv-doc)

**Current**: I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [_tiilt_ lab](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/), [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). 


**Background**: I grew up in [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi) (1994-2000 & 2004-2011) and [Vishakhapatnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam) (2000-04). Received a [Bachelor's of Design](https://www.iitg.ac.in/design/Overview.html) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/design/) (2011-2015). Then got a Ph.D. at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction (in the [_Design, Informal, and Creative Education_ program](https://ci.education.wisc.edu/research/digital-media/)), advised by [Matthew Berland](https://ci.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/berland-matthew/).

In my current position, I work with [Marcelo Worsley](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/people/), primarily on the [SportSense](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/projects/sportsense/index.html) project leading the tech development of numerous tools and activities for sports spaces, implementation of different curricula using these tools, and research around these implementations. I also help mentor undergraduates and graduate students in the lab and assist with research across some of the other ongoing projects as well.
